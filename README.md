### Key Metric:
> **Top 10 Seller Cities by Average Sale Price (in BRL)**

- Highest average prices appear in **Curitiba**, **Rio de Janeiro**, and **Guarulhos**
- Pricing trends vary significantly by geography
- Encourages further investigation into cost of goods, consumer demographics, and seller types in top-performing cities

---

## Analysis & Insights

- **Southern and Southeastern cities** dominate the high-value sale rankings
- Large metros like SÃ£o Paulo are strong performers but do not always lead â€” mid-sized cities sometimes show higher per-unit values
- Suggests that **niche sellers or high-margin product categories** may be clustered in non-obvious locations

---

## Challenges & Considerations

- City names in the dataset sometimes contained variations and typos (standardization was required)
- Average sale price can be skewed by a few expensive products or bundled orders
- The dataset does not include product-level granularity â€” only order-level, so full product mix insight is limited

---

## Conclusion

This dashboard offers a high-level view of **where the most valuable e-commerce sales per order are happening** in Brazil. While volume metrics often point to SÃ£o Paulo or Rio, average price tells a deeper story about **seller quality, niche markets, and buyer demographics**.
